TODO List
link the miner to the map
integrate Redux
figure out why it re-renders the map everytime a key is pressed in the name field

ICE BOX
once a miner is in place and up to a certain level of production create a way to expand into neighboring pixels
  expansions cost less than the initial so they drive down the average cost of the mine complex
  place a limiting factor on expansions to discourage them from exceeding a certain size
  
add an inset box-shadow to each pixel which corresponds to the depletion of the mine
  as it depletes the color darkens and the shadow expands toward the center

create transport network
  build hubs and spokes to connect the mines to the storage facility and from there to the launch facility

storage facility
  linked to by transport hub
  stores ore before transporting to the launch facility
